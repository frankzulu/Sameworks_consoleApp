# Introduction 
The Sameworks project was created as a "follow-along" repository for my blog article [dotNET Core Console App](http://www.afreshdeveloper.com/2021/05/16/afreshdeveloper/).

# Purpose
The purpose was to demo how to get the same functionality in a Console Application you get "out-of-the-box" from an ASP.NET Application. Functionality like:
- Configuration from appsettings.json
- Logging
- Dependency Injection
- Bonus: Command Line Argument Parsing

# Why The Name "Sameworks"?
I'll be the first to admit that I am not creative. I consider myself more autistic than I would artistic. Therefore I employ the help of creative services. The one I used to come up with the name is called [Foswig](https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/). I thought the name was nifty, to say the least. Sameworks because you can create a console application with functionality that works the same as an ASP.NET Application.

# Contribute
I spent several hours of research and reading thru Microsoft Documentation spanning over several days to put this together. My hope is that it saves you hours if not days of research while making a console application that makes use of all the .NET Core functionality that comes "out-of-the-box" from an ASP.NET Application. If you feel there are some things that can be done better please provide some feedback and I'll be more than happy to include it as part of this repository.
